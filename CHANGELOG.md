## Version 0.3.4
- Add comprehensive CLI tests
- Fix bug where fix_patch would try to chdir to a file instead of its parent directory
- Experimentally support fuzzy string matching at the line level
  - Some tests fail; implementation subject to change
- Address some outstanding TODOs while clarifying others

## Version 0.3.3

- Fix f-string syntax errors in `patch_fixer.py`  
- Add comprehensive tests for `split_patch` functionality

## Version 0.3.1
- Make line normalization robust to edge cases
- Add unit tests for line normalization
- Add `hypothesis` to test requirements
- Add more repos to integration tests, focusing on edge cases
  - Most of these fail (growing pains are expected with TDD)

## Version 0.3.0
- Adjust path regex to accommodate rename headers
- Fix remaining integration test failures
  - Stop handling `+` lines different from `-` lines in `normalize_line`
  - Fix bug in `find_hunk_start` where lines consisting only of dashes were ignored
  - Make sure *any line* that gets added to `fixed_lines` has a newline at the end
  - `new_start` in hunk header is now set to `0` on file deletion instead of `1`
- Support renames with less than 100% similarity
- Update test script to keep line endings from the autogenerated diff
- Codestyle changes
  - Normalize line and block comments to all start with a lowercase letter
  - Normalize functions + classes to all have 2 blank lines in between
- TODO:
  - Anything explicitly marked with a `# TODO` comment
  - Fix line lengths and add more blank lines for structure
  - Refactor match/case blocks to each be their own function
  - Set up GitHub Actions / automate releases on GitHub

## Version 0.2.3
- Update README to reflect new usage patterns now that this package is available on PyPI
- Fix bug in error message when a hunk is not found

## Version 0.2.2
- List package on PyPI

## Version 0.2.1
- Experimentally support file deletion in file headers
- Update index counting

## Version 0.2.0
- Move `GitPython` out of test requirements and into main requirements
- Fix a few outstanding bugs with how index lines were parsed
- Add support for regenerating missing index lines
  - Only support in the cases of file deletion, or rename, 
  as anything else would require parsing the patch changes to generate 
  the SHA, which is explicitly out of scope for now
  - Note that this is an experimental new feature that has not been tested

## Version 0.1.0
- Change project name from "code-diff-fixer" to "patch-fixer"
